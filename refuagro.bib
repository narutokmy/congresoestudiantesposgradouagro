	abstract = {A variety of Magnetic Resonance (MR) and nuclear medicine (NM) techniques have been used in symptomatic and presymptomatic SCA2 gene carriers to explore, in vivo, the physiopathological biomarkers of the neurological dysfunctions characterizing the associated progressive disease that presents with a cerebellar syndrome, or less frequently, with a levodopa-responsive parkinsonian syndrome. Morphometry performed on T1-weighted images and diffusion MR imaging enable structural and microstructural evaluation of the brain in presymptomatic and symptomatic SCA2 gene carriers, in whom they show the typical pattern of olivopontocerebellar atrophy observed at neuropathological examination. Proton MR spectroscopy reveals, in the pons and cerebellum of SCA2 gene carriers, a more pronounced degree of abnormal neurochemical profile compared to other spinocerebellar ataxias with decreased NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr, increased mi/Cr ratios, and decreased NAA and increased mI concentrations. These neurochemical abnormalities are detectable also in presymtomatic gene carriers. Resting state functional MRI (rsfMRI) demonstrates decreased functional connectivity within the cerebellum and of the cerebellum with fronto-parietal cortices and basal ganglia in symptomatic SCA2 subjects. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (PET) shows a symmetric decrease of the glucose uptake in the cerebellar cortex, the dentate nucleus, the brainstem and the parahippocampal cortex. Single photon emission tomography and PET using several radiotracers have revealed almost symmetric nigrostriatal dopaminergic dysfunction irrespective of clinical signs of parkinsonism which are already present in presymtomatic gene carriers. Longitudinal small size studies have proven that morphometry and diffusion MR imaging can track neurodegeneration in SCA2, and hence serve as progression biomarkers. So far, such a capability has not been reported for proton MR spectroscopy, rsfMRI and NM techniques. A search for the best surrogate marker for future clinical trials represents the current challenge for the neuroimaging community.},

	abstract = {Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) comprise a heterogeneous group of autosomal dominant disorders. The relative frequency of the different SCA subtypes varies broadly among different geographical and ethnic groups as result of genetic drifts. This review aims to provide an update regarding SCA founders in the American continents and the Caribbean as well as to discuss characteristics of these populations. Clusters of SCAs were detected in Eastern regions of Cuba for SCA2, in South Brazil for SCA3/MJD, and in Southeast regions of Mexico for SCA7. Prevalence rates were obtained and reached 154 (municipality of Báguano, Cuba), 166 (General Câmara, Brazil), and 423 (Tlaltetela, Mexico) patients/100,000 for SCA2, SCA3/MJD, and SCA7, respectively. In contrast, the scattered families with spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) reported all over North and South Americas have been associated to a common Native American ancestry that may have risen in East Asia and migrated to Americas 10,000 to 20,000 years ago. The comprehensive review showed that for each of these SCAs corresponded at least the development of one study group with a large production of scientific evidence often generalizable to all carriers of these conditions. Clusters of SCA populations in the American continents and the Caribbean provide unusual opportunity to gain insights into clinical and genetic characteristics of these disorders. Furthermore, the presence of large populations of patients living close to study centers can favor the development of meaningful clinical trials, which will impact on therapies and on quality of life of SCA carriers worldwide.},

	abstract = {There are several criteria for determination of the most appropriate cut-off value in a diagnostic test with continuous results. Mostly based on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, there are various methods to determine the test cut-off value. The most common criteria are the point on ROC curve where the sensitivity and specificity of the test are equal; the point on the curve with minimum distance from the left-upper corner of the unit square; and the point where the Youden’s index is maximum. There are also methods mainly based on Bayesian decision analysis. Herein, we show that a proposed method that maximizes the weighted number needed to misdiagnose, an index of diagnostic test effectiveness we previously proposed, is the most appropriate technique compared to the aforementioned ones. For determination of the cut-off value, we need to know the pretest probability of the disease of interest as well as the costs incurred by misdiagnosis. This means that even for a certain diagnostic test, the cut-off value is not universal and should be determined for each region and for each disease condition.},

	abstract = {The prevalence of the non-alcoholic fatty liver disease has reached major proportions, being estimated to affect one-quarter of the global population. The reference techniques, which include liver biopsy and the magnetic resonance imaging proton density fat fraction, have objective practical and financial limitations to their routine use in the detection and quantification of liver steatosis. Therefore, there has been a rising necessity for the development of new inexpensive, widely applicable and reliable non-invasive diagnostic tools. The controlled attenuation parameter has been considered the point-of-care technique for the assessment of liver steatosis for a long period of time. Recently, many ultrasound (US) system manufacturers have developed proprietary software solutions for the quantification of liver steatosis. Some of these methods have already been extensively tested with very good performance results reported, while others are still under evaluation. This manuscript reviews the currently available US-based methods for diagnosing and grading liver steatosis, including their classification and performance results, with an appraisal of the importance of this armamentarium in daily clinical practice.},

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 158 LABC patients with FDG-avid, pathology-proven, metastatic ALN who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and curative surgery. Tumor and ALN texture parameters were extracted from pretreatment 18F-FDG PET/CT using Chang-Gung Image Texture Analysis software. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression was performed to select the most significant predictive texture parameters. The predictive impact of texture parameters was evaluated for both progression-free survival and pathologic NAC response. Results: The median follow-up period of 36.8 months and progression of disease (PD) was observed in 36 patients. In the univariate analysis, ALN textures (minimum standardized uptake value (SUV) (p = 0.026), SUV skewness (p = 0.038), SUV bias-corrected Kurtosis (p = 0.034), total lesion glycolysis (p = 0.011)), tumor textures (low-intensity size zone emphasis (p = 0.045), minimum SUV (p = 0.047), and homogeneity (p = 0.041)) were significant texture predictors. On the Cox regression analysis, ALN SUV skewness was an independent texture predictor of PD (p = 0.016, hazard ratio 2.3, 95\% confidence interval 1.16–4.58). Conclusions: ALN texture feature from pretreatment 18F-FDG PET/CT is useful for the prediction of LABC progression.},

	abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a preventable, treatable, progressive chronic disease characterized by persistent airflow limitation. Patients with COPD deserve special consideration regarding treatment in this fragile population for preclinical health management. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel lung radiomics combination vector generated by a generalized linear model (GLM) and Lasso algorithm for COPD stage classification based on an auto-metric graph neural network (AMGNN) with a meta-learning strategy. Firstly, the parenchyma images were segmented from chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) images by ResU-Net. Second, lung radiomics features are extracted from the parenchyma images by PyRadiomics. Third, a novel lung radiomics combination vector (3 + 106) is constructed by the GLM and Lasso algorithm for determining the radiomics risk factors (K = 3) and radiomics node features (d = 106). Last, the COPD stage is classified based on the AMGNN. The results show that compared with the convolutional neural networks and machine learning models, the AMGNN based on constructed novel lung radiomics combination vector performs best, achieving an accuracy of 0.943, precision of 0.946, recall of 0.943, F1-score of 0.943, and ACU of 0.984. Furthermore, it is found that our method is effective for COPD stage classification.},

In this study, we compared the clinical outcome of breast cancer patients with different residual tumor patterns (RTP) on a breast MRI after NAC. (2) Methods: A total of 91 patients with breast cancer who received NAC and subsequent curative surgery were selected. All included patient had residual breast cancer after NAC and showed a partial response on a breast MRI. Pre- and post-treatment were reviewed by an experienced radiologist to evaluate different RTP, and classified into two groups: concentric and scattered patterns. The clinicopathologic parameters and survival outcomes [recurrence-free survival (RFS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS)] were analyzed according to different RTP. (3) Results: Patients with a scattered pattern had a larger extent of pre-treated non-mass enhancement and more frequently received total mastectomy. With a median follow-up period of 37 months, RTP were not significantly associated with RFS or DMFS. (4) Conclusions: In the patients with residual breast cancer after NAC, RTP on an MRI had no effect on the patients’ clinical outcome. The curative resection of the tumor bed and securing the negative resection margins appear to be important in the treatment of patients with residual breast cancer after NAC.},

The study aims to highlight GP features based on clinical findings and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) characteristics. We retrospectively reviewed eleven patients from a cohort undergoing targeted biopsy between August 2019 and August 2021. Retrospective data including serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, PSA density and mpMRI findings were collected. Histopathology revealed seven cases of non-specific GP and four cases of specific GP as a result of intravesical Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) instillation. All lesions showed low signal intensity in T2w images, restricted diffusivity with hyperintensity in Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI) and low Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) values. In Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced (DCE) imaging, the enhancement was high-peak and persistent in the majority of cases, especially in BCG-GPs. Moreover, almost all those latter lesions showed avascular core and peripheral rim enhancement. All areas identified on mpMRI were assessed with high to very high suspicion to hold prostate cancer (PIRADS v2.1 scores 4–5). Despite recent advances in imaging modalities and serological investigations, it is currently still a challenge to identify granulomatous prostatitis. Histopathology remains the gold standard in disease diagnosis. However, a differential diagnosis should be considered in patients with prior treatment with BCG.},

	abstract = {Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is a rare genetic disorder leading to degenerative processes. So far, no effective treatment has been found. Therefore, it is important to assist the development of medication with imaging biomarkers reflecting disease status and progress. Ten FRDA patients (mean age 37 ± 14 years; four female) and 10 age- and sex-matched controls were included. Acquisition of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data for quantitative susceptibility mapping, R1, R2 relaxometry and diffusion imaging was performed at 7 Tesla. Results of volume of interest (VOI)-based analyses of the quantitative data were compared with a voxel-based morphometry (VBM) evaluation. Differences between patients and controls were assessed using the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA; p {\textless} 0.01) with age and sex as covariates, effect size of group differences, and correlations with disease characteristics with Spearman correlation coefficient. For the VBM analysis, a statistical threshold of 0.001 for uncorrected and 0.05 for corrected p-values was used. Statistically significant differences between FRDA patients and controls were found in five out of twelve investigated structures, and statistically significant correlations with disease characteristics were revealed. Moreover, VBM revealed significant white matter atrophy within regions of the brainstem, and the cerebellum. These regions overlapped partially with brain regions for which significant differences between healthy controls and patients were found in the VOI-based quantitative MRI evaluation. It was shown that two independent analyses provided overlapping results. Moreover, positive results on correlations with disease characteristics were found, indicating that these quantitative MRI parameters could provide more detailed information and assist the search for effective treatments.},

The study aimed to evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of neurofilament light chain (NfL) as a biomarker of neurodegeneration in relation to SARA score. In this prospective trial, one visit of 42 A-T patients aged 1.3–25.6 years (mean 11.6 ± 7.3 years) was performed, in which NfL was determined from serum by ELISA. Additionally, a neurological examination of the patients was performed. Blood was collected from 19 healthy volunteers ≥ 12 years of age. We found significantly increased levels of NfL in patients with A-T compared to healthy controls (21.5 ± 3.6 pg/mL vs. 9.3 ± 0.49 pg/mL, p ≤ 0.01). There was a significant correlation of NfL with age, AFP, and SARA. NfL is a new potential progression biomarker in blood for neurodegeneration in A-T which increases with age.},

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (1H-MRS) provide promising non-invasive diagnostic and follow-up tools, also serving to evaluate therapies efficacy. However, pre-clinical studies showing relationship between MRI-MRS based biomarkers and functional performance are missing, which hampers an efficient clinical translation of therapeutics. This study assessed motor behaviour, neurochemical profiles, and morphometry of the cerebellum of MJD transgenic mice and patients aiming at establishing magnetic-resonance-based biomarkers. 1H-MRS and structural MRI measurements of MJD transgenic mice were performed with a 9.4 Tesla scanner, correlated with motor performance on rotarod and compared with data collected from human patients. We found decreased cerebellar white and grey matter and enlargement of the fourth ventricle in both MJD mice and human patients as compared to controls. N-acetylaspartate (NAA), NAA + N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAA + NAAG), Glutamate, and Taurine, were significantly decreased in MJD mouse cerebellum regardless of age, whereas myo-Inositol (Ins) was increased at early time-points. Lower neurochemical ratios levels (NAA/Ins and NAA/total Choline), previously correlated with worse clinical status in SCAs, were also observed in MJD mice cerebella. NAA, NAA + NAAG, Glutamate, and Taurine were also positively correlated with MJD mice motor performance. Importantly, these 1H-MRS results were largely analogous to those found for MJD in human studies and in our pilot data in human patients. We have established a magnetic resonance-based biomarker approach to monitor novel therapies in preclinical studies and human clinical trials.},

	abstract = {The growing number of modalities (e.g. multi-omics, imaging and clinical data) characterizing a given disease provides physicians and statisticians with complementary facets reflecting the disease process but emphasizes the need for novel statistical methods of data analysis able to unify these views. Such data sets are indeed intrinsically structured in blocks, where each block represents a set of variables observed on a group of individuals. Therefore, classical statistical tools cannot be applied without altering their organization, with the risk of information loss. Regularized generalized canonical correlation analysis (RGCCA) and its sparse generalized canonical correlation analysis (SGCCA) counterpart are component-based methods for exploratory analyses of data sets structured in blocks of variables. Rather than operating sequentially on parts of the measurements, the RGCCA/SGCCA-based integrative analysis method aims at summarizing the relevant information between and within the blocks. It processes a priori information defining which blocks are supposed to be linked to one another, thus reflecting hypotheses about the biology underlying the data blocks. It also requires the setting of extra parameters that need to be carefully adjusted.Here, we provide practical guidelines for the use of RGCCA/SGCCA. We also illustrate the flexibility and usefulness of RGCCA/SGCCA on a unique cohort of patients with four genetic subtypes of spinocerebellar ataxia, in which we obtained multiple data sets from brain volumetry and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and metabolomic and lipidomic analyses. As a first step toward the extraction of multimodal biomarkers, and through the reduction to a few meaningful components and the visualization of relevant variables, we identified possible markers of disease progression.},

The aim of this study was to measure NfL longitudinally in autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) and establish correlation with clinical and imaging parameters. We enrolled 62 pathological expansions carriers (17 SCA1, 13 SCA2, 19 SCA3, and 13 SCA7) and 19 age-matched controls in a prospective biomarker study between 2011 and 2015 and followed for 24 months at the Paris Brain Institute. We performed neurological examination, brain 3 T MRI and plasma NfL measurements using an ultrasensitive single-molecule array at baseline and at the two-year follow-up visit. We evaluated NfL correlations with ages, CAG repeat sizes, clinical scores and volumetric brain MRIs. NfL levels were significantly higher in SCAs than controls at both time points (p {\textless} 0.001). Age-adjusted NfL levels were significantly correlated at baseline with clinical scores (p {\textless} 0.01). We identified optimal NfL cut-off concentrations to differentiate controls from carriers for each genotype (SCA1 16.87 pg/mL, SCA2, 19.1 pg/mL, SCA3 16.04 pg/mL, SCA7 16.67 pg/mL). For all SCAs, NfL concentration was stable over two years (p = 0.95) despite a clinical progression (p {\textless} 0.0001). Clinical progression between baseline and follow-up was associated with higher NfL concentrations at baseline (p = 0.04). Of note, all premanifest carriers with NfL levels close to cut off concentrations had signs of the disease at follow-up. For all SCAs, the higher the observed NfL, the lower the pons volume at baseline (p {\textless} 0.01) and follow-up (p = 0.02). Higher NfL levels at baseline in all SCAs predicted a decrease in cerebellar volume (p = 0.03). This result remained significant for SCA2 only among all genotypes (p = 0.02). Overall, plasma NfL levels at baseline in SCA expansion carriers predict cerebellar volume change and clinical score progression. NfL levels might help refine inclusion criteria for clinical trials in carriers with very subtle signs.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Given that new therapeutic options for spinocerebellar ataxias are on the horizon, there is a need for markers that reflect disease-related alterations, in particular, in the preataxic stage, in which clinical scales are lacking sensitivity.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to quantify regional brain volumes and upper cervical spinal cord areas in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 in vivo across the entire time course of the disease.
METHODS: We applied a brain segmentation approach that included a lobular subsegmentation of the cerebellum to magnetic resonance images of 210 ataxic and 48 preataxic spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 mutation carriers and 63 healthy controls. In addition, cervical cord cross-sectional areas were determined at 2 levels.
RESULTS: The metrics of cervical spinal cord segments C3 and C2, medulla oblongata, pons, and pallidum, and the cerebellar anterior lobe were reduced in preataxic mutation carriers compared with controls. Those of cervical spinal cord segments C2 and C3, medulla oblongata, pons, midbrain, cerebellar lobules crus II and X, cerebellar white matter, and pallidum were reduced in ataxic compared with nonataxic carriers. Of all metrics studied, pontine volume showed the steepest decline across the disease course. It covaried with ataxia severity, CAG repeat length, and age. The multivariate model derived from this analysis explained 46.33\% of the variance of pontine volume.
CONCLUSION: Regional brain and spinal cord tissue loss in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 starts before ataxia onset. Pontine volume appears to be the most promising imaging biomarker candidate for interventional trials that aim at slowing the progression of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3. © 2021 The Authors.

	abstract = {Background and Introduction: Expansion of GAA triplet repeats in the first intron of the frataxin gene causes Friedreich’s ataxia. Genetic testing in such condition is important to initiate the appropriate genetic counseling for the family members. The conventional genetic tests used in the diagnosis of Friedreich’s ataxia are southern blot, short and long PCR. Recently, triplet repeat primed polymerase chain reaction (TP-PCR) methodology was described in the diagnosis of Friedreich’s ataxia, especially for detection of long repeats. Accurate genetic diagnosis of Friedreich’s ataxia helps in differentiating it from other ataxias and helps provide appropriate genetic counseling for such families. Extended family screening and genetic counseling can prevent birth of children with Friedreich’s ataxia in these families., Materials and Methods: TP-PCR was carried out in 37 samples obtained from Neurology clinic, Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences. The amplified products were subjected to genotyping on a ABI 310 genetic analyser. For heterozygosity, the samples were processed for short and long range PCR., Results: A total of 37 samples of suspected cases of Friedreich ataxia were analysed. Of these, 81\% samples were confirmed as Friedreich ataxia and 19\% of samples were found to be negative for Friedreich’s ataxia by TP-PCR. Extended family screening was done in 2 of the families. Among the 7 individuals screened, 4 were identified as carriers and genetic counseling was provided to them., Conclusions: This is first report from India which describes the molecular diagnosis of Friedreich’s ataxia by TP-PCR, its utility in extended family screening and genetic counseling. It qualifies as a highly reliable, sensitive and robust technique that can easily be set up in any laboratory.},

	abstract = {Background
Hereditary ataxias are a heterogeneous group of degenerative diseases of the cerebellum, brainstem, and spinal cord. They may present with isolated ataxia or with additional symptoms going beyond cerebellar deficits. There are an increasing number of clinical studies with the goal to define the natural history of these disorders, develop biomarkers, and investigate therapeutic interventions. Especially, early and preclinical disease stages are currently of particular interest.

Methods and Results
Evidence‐based, we review standards for sampling and storage of biomaterials, clinical and neuropsychological assessment, as well as neurophysiology and neuroimaging and recommendations for standardized assessment of ataxia patients in multicenter studies.

Conclusions

DNA, RNA, serum, and, if possible, cerebrospinal fluid samples should be processed following established standards. Clinical assessment in ataxia studies must include use of a validated clinical ataxia scale. There are several validated clinical ataxia scales available. There are no instruments that were specifically designed for assessing neuropsychological and psychiatric symptoms in ataxia disorders. We provide a list of tests that may prove valuable. Quantitative performance tests have the potential to supplement clinical scales. They provide additional objective and quantitative information. Posturography and quantitative movement analysis—despite valid approaches—require standardization before implemented in multicenter studies. Standardization of neurophysiological tools, as required for multicenter interventional trials, is still lacking. Future multicenter neuroimaging studies in ataxias should implement quality assurance measures as defined by the ADNI or other consortia. MRI protocols should allow morphometric analyses.},

	abstract = {BackgroundSpinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a complex cerebrocerebellar disease primarily characterized by ataxia symptoms alongside motor and cognitive impairments. The heterogeneous clinical presentation of SCA3 necessitates correlations between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical findings in reflecting progressive disease changes. At present, an attempt to systematically examine the brain-behavior relationship in SCA3, specifically, the correlation between MRI and clinical findings, is lacking.ObjectiveWe investigated the association strength between MRI abnormality and each clinical symptom to understand the brain-behavior relationship in SCA3.MethodsWe conducted a systematic review on Medline and Scopus to review studies evaluating the brain MRI profile of SCA3 using structural MRI (volumetric, voxel-based morphometry, surface analysis), magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and diffusion tensor imaging, including their correlations with clinical outcomes.ResultsOf 1,767 articles identified, 29 articles met the eligibility criteria. According to the National Institutes of Health quality assessment tool for case-control studies, all articles were of excellent quality. This systematic review found that SCA3 neuropathology contributes to widespread brain degeneration, affecting the cerebellum and brainstem. The disease gradually impedes the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia in the late stages of SCA3. Most findings reported moderate correlations (r = 0.30–0.49) between MRI features in several regions and clinical findings. Regardless of the MRI techniques, most studies focused on the brainstem and cerebellum.ConclusionsClinical findings suggest that rather than individual brain regions, the connectivity between different brain regions in distributed networks (i.e., cerebellar-cerebral network) may be responsible for motor and neurocognitive function in SCA3. This review highlights the importance of evaluating the progressive changes of the cerebellar-cerebral networks in SCA3 patients, specifically the functional connectivity. Given the relative lack of knowledge about functional connectivity on SCA3, future studies should investigate possible functional connectivity abnormalities in SCA3 using fMRI.},

This paper provides suggested diagnostic pathways for the general neurologist, based on Ataxia UK’s guidelines for professionals. MR brain scanning can provide diagnostic clues, as well as identify ‘structural’ causes such as tumours and multiple sclerosis. Advances in molecular genetics, including the wider and cheaper availability of ‘next-generation sequencing’, have enabled clinicians to identify many more cases with a genetic cause. Finally, autoimmunity is probably an under-recognised cause of progressive ataxia: as well as patients with antigliadin antibodies there are smaller numbers with various antibodies, including some associated with cancer. There are a few treatable ataxias, but also symptomatic treatments to help people with the spectrum of complications that might accompany progressive ataxias. Multidisciplinary team involvement and allied health professionals’ input are critical to excellent patient care, including in the palliative phase. We can no longer justify a nihilistic approach to the management of ataxia.},

	abstract = {Abstract With molecular treatments coming into reach for spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), easily accessible, cross-species validated biomarkers for human and preclinical trials are warranted, particularly for the preataxic disease stage. We assessed serum levels of neurofilament light (NfL) and phosphorylated neurofilament heavy (pNfH) in ataxic and preataxic subjects of two independent multicentric SCA3 cohorts and in a SCA3 knock-in mouse model. Ataxic SCA3 subjects showed increased levels of both NfL and pNfH. In preataxic subjects, NfL levels increased with proximity to the individual expected onset of ataxia, with significant NfL elevations already 7.5 years before onset. Cross-sectional NfL levels correlated with both disease severity and longitudinal disease progression. Blood NfL and pNfH increases in human SCA3 were each paralleled by similar changes in SCA3 knock-in mice, here also starting already at the presymptomatic stage, closely following ataxin-3 aggregation and preceding Purkinje cell loss in the brain. Blood neurofilaments, particularly NfL, might thus provide easily accessible, cross-species validated biomarkers in both ataxic and preataxic SCA3, associated with earliest neuropathological changes, and serve as progression, proximity-to-onset and, potentially, treatment-response markers in both human and preclinical SCA3 trials.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Objective and quantitative data to define cerebellar vermis and/or brain stem hypoplasia in children are lacking. Our aim was to provide MR imaging biometric references for the cerebellar vermis and brain stem from a large cohort of children with normal cerebellums.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MR imaging data were retrospectively selected from our hospital data base from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2017. All MR imaging examinations of children between 1 day and 15 years of age, including midline sagittal sections, were included. Children with a clinical history or MR imaging abnormalities that may affect the posterior fossa were excluded. We manually measured four 2D parameters: vermian height, anterior-posterior diameter of the vermis, anterior-posterior diameter of the midbrain-pons junction, and anterior-posterior midpons diameter. The inter- and intraobserver agreement was evaluated.
RESULTS: Seven hundred eighteen children were included (372 boys and 346 girls), from 1 day to 15 years of age. Normal values (third to 97th percentiles) were provided for each parameter. The vermis parameters showed a rapid growth phase during the first year, a slower growth until the fifth year, and finally a near-plateau phase. The brain stem parameters showed more progressive growth. The intra- and interobserver agreement was excellent for all parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: We provide reference biometric data of the vermis and the brain stem using simple and reproducible measurements that are easy to use in daily practice. The relevance of these 2D measurements should be further validated in diseases associated with cerebellar abnormalities.},

To determine how the neurodegenerative process in the central nervous system of patients with MJD correlates with the size of expanded CAG repeats in the MJD1 gene and other factors, we performed detailed quantitative analyses of findings of magnetic resonance imaging of the central nervous system of 21 patients with MJD of various ages and with various sizes of expanded CAG repeats. We found that atrophy of the brainstem and cerebellar vermis in MJD patients is closely correlated not only with the size of expanded CAG repeat in the MJD1 gene but also with patient age, which suggests that the neurodegenerative process in MJD is regulated by the size of expanded CAG repeats as well as by the patient age.},

OBJECTIVE: To investigate clinical, genetic, and neuroradiological characteristics of SCAs in Korean kindreds.
SETTING: University hospital.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Molecular analysis of SCA types 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7 and dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy and magnetic resonance imaging were performed in 67 patients with ataxia.
RESULTS: The overall prevalence of 6 types of SCAs was 54\% (36 of 67 patients), irrespective of patients' family histories. The most frequent type was SCA7 (11 patients, 16\%), followed by SCA3 and SCA6 (10 patients, 15\% for both). Certain clinical features suggested specific gene defects, although overlap among the 6 SCA subtypes was broad: visual disturbance was noted in patients with SCA3 and SCA6, dystonia in 1 patient with SCA6, and sporadic ataxia without pigmentary retinopathy in 1 patient with SCA7. Compared with the control subjects, patients with SCAs and multisystem atrophy had a significant enlargement of the fourth ventricle and atrophy of the cerebellum (P{\textless}.01). An inverse correlation between the pontine area and the degree of cerebellar atrophy was found in patients with multisystem atrophy (r = -0.73) but not in patients with SCAs. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed significant differences in pattern of morphological alterations among patients with different SCA gene mutations. A similar finding was observed in SCA patients with atypical phenotype.
CONCLUSION: The clinical and neuroradiological characteristics of Korean patients with SCAs might be helpful in detecting underlying gene mutations.},

	abstract = {Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3/Machado–Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD) is a progressive autosomal dominantly inherited cerebellar ataxia characterized by the aggregation of polyglutamine-expanded protein within neuronal nuclei in the brain, which can lead to brain damage that precedes the onset of clinical manifestations. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques such as morphometric MRI, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) have gained increasing attention as non-invasive and quantitative methods for the assessment of structural and functional alterations in clinical SCA3/MJD patients as well as preclinical carriers. Morphometric MRI has demonstrated typical patterns of atrophy or volume loss in the cerebellum and brainstem with extensive lesions in some supratentorial areas. DTI has detected widespread microstructural alterations in brain white matter, which indicate disrupted brain anatomical connectivity. Task-related fMRI has presented unusual brain activation patterns within the cerebellum and some extracerebellar tissue, reflecting the decreased functional connectivity of these brain regions in SCA3/MJD subjects. MRS has revealed abnormal neurochemical profiles, such as the levels or ratios of N-acetyl aspartate, choline, and creatine, in both clinical cases and preclinical cases before the alterations in brain anatomical structure. Moreover, a number of studies have reported correlations of MR imaging alterations with clinical and genetic features. The utility of these MR imaging techniques can help to identify preclinical SCA3/MJD carriers, monitor disease progression, evaluate response to therapeutic interventions, and illustrate the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the occurrence, development, and prognosis of SCA3/MJD.},

All individuals underwent the same protocol for high-resolution T1 and T2 images and diffusion tensor imaging acquisition (32 directions) in a 3-T scanner. We used Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (FSL 4.1.4) to analyze diffusion data and SPM8/DARTEL for voxel-based morphometry of infratentorial structures. T2-relaxometry of cerebellum was performed with in-house-developed software Aftervoxel and Interactive Volume Segmentation (IVS). Patients' mean age at onset was 40.02 ± 11.48 years and mean duration of disease was 9.3 ± 2.7 years. Mean International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS) and Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) scores were 32.08 ± 4.01 and 14.65 ± 7.33, respectively. Voxel-based morphometry demonstrated a volumetric reduction of gray and white matter in cerebellum and brainstem (P {\textless}.001). We found reduced fractional anisotropy (P {\textless}.05) in the cerebellum and brainstem. There were also areas of increased radial diffusivity (P {\textless}.05) in the cerebellum, brainstem, thalamus, frontal lobes, and temporal lobes. In addition, we found decreased T2-relaxation values in the white matter of the right cerebellar hemisphere.

METHODS: Thirty-six SCA3/MJD patients, and 27 sex, age-matched healthy controls were scanned with (1)H-MRS for N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline (Cho) and creatine (Cr). We made cerebellar vermis, cerebellar peduncles, cerebellar cortex, and dentatum as the region of interests (ROI), and finally got access to NAA/Cr, Cho/Cr, and NAA/Cho ratios. We also examined the CAG repeat numbers of MJD1 gene, scored the 36 patients by the scale for the assessment and rating of ataxia (SARA), analyzed the differences in ratios between SCA3/MJD patients and the control group, and explored whether relevance existed between these ratios and duration of the disease, age of onset, CAG repeat times, and SARA scores respectively.
RESULTS: The ratio of NAA/Cr in SCA3/MJD patients showed a significant reduction in the cerebellar cortex, dentatum, cerebellar vermis and medipeduncle (P{\textless}0.01) compared with the controls. The ratio of NAA/Cho also showed significant reduction in the dentatum and cerebellar vermis (P{\textless}0.01). A number of correlations were found between the metabolite ratios of (1)H-MRS and duration of the disease, age of onset, expanded CAG and SARA score in SCA3/MJD patients.
CONCLUSION: (1)H-MRS, which shows the neural metabolic changes in the cerebella of SCA3/MJD patients, provides useful information about the severity of SCA3/MJD.},

	abstract = {The human cerebellum plays an important role in coordination tasks. Diseases such as spinocerebellar ataxias tend to cause severe damage to the cerebellum, leading patients to a progressive loss of motor coordination. The detection of such damages can help specialists to approximate the state of the disease, as well as to perform statistical analysis, in order to propose treatment therapies for the patients. Manual segmentation of such patterns from magnetic resonance imaging is a very difficult and time-consuming task, and is not a viable solution if the number of images to process is relatively large. In recent years, deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs or convnets) have experienced an increased development, and many researchers have used them to automatically segment medical images. In this research, we propose the use of convolutional neural networks for automatically segmenting the cerebellar fissures from brain magnetic resonance imaging. Three models are presented, based on the same CNN architecture, for obtaining three different binary masks: fissures, cerebellum with fissures, and cerebellum without fissures. The models perform well in terms of precision and efficiency. Evaluation results show that convnets can be trained for such purposes, and could be considered as additional tools in the diagnosis and characterization of neurodegenerative diseases.},

Classified according to gene discovery, specific features of the SCAs - clinical, laboratorial, and neuroradiological (NR) - can facilitate establishing the diagnosis. The purpose of this study was to review the particular NR abnormalities in the main SCAs.
Methods: We conducted a literature search on this topic.
Results: The main NR characteristics of brain imaging (magnetic resonance imaging or computerized tomography) in SCAs were: (1) pure cerebellar atrophy; (2) cerebellar atrophy with other findings (e.g., pontine, olivopontocerebellar, spinal, cortical, or subcortical atrophy; "hot cross bun sign", and demyelinating lesions); (3) selective cerebellar atrophy; (4) no cerebellar atrophy.
Discussion: The main NR abnormalities in the commonest SCAs, are not pathognomonic of any specific genotype, but can be helpful in limiting the diagnostic options. We are progressing to a better understanding of the SCAs, not only genetically, but also pathologically; NR is helpful in the challenge of diagnosing the specific genotype of SCA.},

MR imaging is the best-studied surrogate biomarker candidate for polyglutamine expansion spinocerebellar ataxias, though with conflicting results. We aimed to review quantitative central nervous system MR imaging technique findings in patients with polyglutamine expansion spinocerebellar ataxias and correlations with well-established clinical and molecular disease markers.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, LILACS, and Cochrane data bases of clinical trials between January 1995 and January 2016, for quantitative MR imaging volumetric approaches, MR spectroscopy, diffusion tensor imaging, or other quantitative techniques, comparing patients with polyglutamine expansion spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) with controls. Pertinent details for each study regarding participants, imaging methods, and results were extracted.
RESULTS: After reviewing the 706 results, 18 studies were suitable for inclusion: 2 studies in SCA1, 1 in SCA2, 15 in SCA3, 1 in SCA7, 1 in SCA1 and SCA6 presymptomatic carriers, and none in SCA17 and dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy. Cerebellar hemispheres and vermis, whole brain stem, midbrain, pons, medulla oblongata, cervical spine, striatum, and thalamus presented significant atrophy in SCA3. The caudate, putamen and whole brain stem presented similar sensitivity to change compared with ataxia scales after 2 years of follow-up in a single prospective study in SCA3. MR spectroscopy and DTI showed abnormalities only in cross-sectional studies in SCA3. Results from single studies in other polyglutamine expansion spinocerebellar ataxias should be replicated in different cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS: Additional cross-sectional and prospective volumetric analysis, MR spectroscopy, and DTI studies are necessary in polyglutamine expansion spinocerebellar ataxias. The properties of preclinical disease biomarkers (presymptomatic) of MR imaging should be targeted in future studies.},

We highlight MRI studies with the most potential for utility in pending ataxia trials and underscore advances in disease characterization and diagnostics in the field.
RECENT FINDINGS: With availability of advanced MRI acquisition methods and specialized software dedicated to the analysis of MRI of the cerebellum, patterns of cerebellar atrophy in different degenerative ataxias are increasingly well defined. The field further embraced rigorous multimodal investigations to study network-level microstructural and functional brain changes and their neurochemical correlates. MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy were shown to be more sensitive to disease progression than clinical scales and to detect abnormalities in premanifest mutation carriers.
SUMMARY: Magnetic resonance techniques are increasingly well placed for characterizing the expression and progression of degenerative ataxias. The most impactful work has arguably come through multi-institutional studies that monitor relatively large cohorts, multimodal investigations that assess the sensitivity of different measures and their interrelationships, and novel imaging approaches that are targeted to known pathophysiology (e.g., iron and spinal imaging in Friedreich ataxia). These multimodal, multi-institutional studies are paving the way to clinical trial readiness and enhanced understanding of disease in degenerative ataxias.},

Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) is an inherited (autosomal dominant), progressive, neurodegenerative, and heterogeneous disease that mainly affects the cerebellum. SCA is a subset of hereditary cerebellar ataxia and is a rare disease. To date, more than 40 distinct genetic SCAs have been identified which are classified according to the genetic loci in order of identification. SCA1 was the first SCA described and then further subtypes are identified sequentially. SCA doesn't compulsorily mean that it is restricted to the cerebellum and spinal cord. It may involve the other parts of the central nervous system as well, such as pontine nuclei, spinal cord, peripheral nerves, cortex, basal ganglia, etc. SCA6 is restricted to the cerebellum whereas SCA2 spares cerebellum.[1] Well defined and common types are SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, and SCA6 which accounts for more than half of cases and other rare variants constitute the remaining cases.[1][2] SCA is very complex to understand both genotypically and phenotypically and very difficult to describe all variants at one time.},

In this consensus manuscript, the authors discuss their current views on the identified molecular processes causing or modulating the neurodegenerative phenotype in spinocerebellar ataxias with the common opinion of translating the new knowledge acquired into candidate targets for therapy. The following topics are discussed: transcription dysregulation, protein aggregation, autophagy, ion channels, the role of mitochondria, RNA toxicity, modulators of neurodegeneration and current therapeutic approaches. Overall point of consensus includes the common vision of neurodegeneration in SCAs as a multifactorial, progressive and reversible process, at least in early stages. Specific points of consensus include the role of the dysregulation of protein folding, transcription, bioenergetics, calcium handling and eventual cell death with apoptotic features of neurons during SCA disease progression. Unresolved questions include how the dysregulation of these pathways triggers the onset of symptoms and mediates disease progression since this understanding may allow effective treatments of SCAs within the window of reversibility to prevent early neuronal damage. Common opinions also include the need for clinical detection of early neuronal dysfunction, for more basic research to decipher the early neurodegenerative process in SCAs in order to give rise to new concepts for treatment strategies and for the translation of the results to preclinical studies and, thereafter, in clinical practice.},

	abstract = {Objective
Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is an autosomal dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disease mainly affecting the cerebellum and brainstem. In this Cuban‐German research collaboration, we aimed to characterize atrophy patterns and associations with clinical measures in preclinical and manifest SCA2.

Methods
In this study, 16 nonmanifest SCA2 mutation carriers, 26 manifest patients with SCA2, and 18 healthy control subjects underwent magnetic resonance imaging, as well as genetic and clinical characterization including assessment of ataxia (Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia) and saccade velocity in Cuba were enrolled. Semiautomated quantitative volumetry of the cerebellum and brainstem, subdivided into the medulla oblongata, the pontine brainstem, and mesencephalon was performed. Additionally, the anteroposterior diameter of the pontine brainstem was measured.

Results
Analysis of volumetric data revealed degeneration of the cerebellum and brainstem, in particular of pontine volumes and the anteroposterior diameter of the pons, in both manifest SCA2 patients and individuals at risk for SCA2 compared to controls. Comparing patients with nonataxic preclinical SCA2 mutation carriers, we found more pronounced reductions of the pontine brainstem and cerebellum in manifest SCA2. Volumetric data further showed associations with CAG repeat length and predicted age of onset in preclinical SCA2 individuals, and by trend with ataxia signs in patients. Although saccade velocity was associated with reduction in the pontine brainstem in preclinical and manifest SCA2, reduced ability to suppress interfering stimuli measured by the Stroop task was related to cerebellar volume loss in patients.

Interpretation
Preclinical SCA2 mutation carriers exhibit brain abnormalities, which could be targeted as surrogate parameters for disease progression and in future preventive trials.},

	abstract = {This cross-sectional study investigated the correlation between the CAG repeat length and the degeneration of cerebellum in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) patients based on neuroimaging approaches. Forty SCA3 patients were recruited and classified into two subgroups according to their CAG repeat lengths (≥74 and {\textless}74). We measured each patient's Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) score, N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/creatine (Cr) ratios based on magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and 3-dimensional fractal dimension (3D-FD) values derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results. Furthermore, the 3D-FD values were used to construct structural covariance networks based on graph theoretical analysis. The results revealed that SCA3 patients with a longer CAG repeat length demonstrated earlier disease onset. However, the CAG repeat length did not significantly correlate with their SARA scores, cerebellar NAA/Cr ratios or cerebellar 3D-FD values. Network dissociation between cerebellar regions and parietal-occipital regions was found in SCA3 patients with CAG≥74, but not in those with CAG{\textless}74. In conclusion, the CAG repeat length is uncorrelated with the change of SARA score, cerebellar function and cerebellar structure in SCA3. Nevertheless, a longer CAG repeat length may indicate early structural covariance network dissociation.},

In the present study, we performed a global metabolomic analysis to identify pathogenic biochemical pathways and novel biomarkers implicated in SCA3 patients. Metabolic profiling of serum samples from 13 preclinical SCA3 patients, 13 symptomatic SCA3 patients, and 15 healthy controls were mapped using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry techniques. The symptomatic SCA3 patients showed a metabolic profile significantly distinct from those of the preclinical SCA3 patients and healthy controls. The principal differential metabolites were involved in the amino acid (AA) metabolism and fatty acid metabolism pathways. In addition, four candidate serum biomarkers, FFA 16:1 (palmitoleic acid), FFA 18:3 (linolenic acid), L-Proline and L-Tryptophan, were selected to discriminate between symptomatic SCA3 patients and healthy controls by receiver operator curve analysis with an area under the curve of 0.979. Our study demonstrates that symptomatic SCA3 patients present distinct metabolic profiles with perturbed AA metabolism and fatty acid metabolism, and FFA 16:1, FFA 18:3, L-Proline and L-Tryptophan are identified as potential disease biomarkers.},

In the past decade, development of the new magnetic resonance imaging technique, quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), has enabled for the more comprehensive investigation of iron distribution in the brain. The aim of this systematic review was to provide a synthesis of the findings from existing QSM studies in neurodegenerative diseases. We identified 80 records by searching MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and PsycInfo databases. The disorders investigated in these studies included Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Wilson's disease, Huntington's disease, Friedreich's ataxia, spinocerebellar ataxia, Fabry disease, myotonic dystrophy, pantothenate-kinase-associated neurodegeneration, and mitochondrial membrane protein-associated neurodegeneration. As a general pattern, QSM revealed increased magnetic susceptibility (suggestive of increased iron content) in the brain regions associated with the pathology of each disorder, such as the amygdala and caudate nucleus in Alzheimer's disease, the substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease, motor cortex in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, basal ganglia in Huntington's disease, and cerebellar dentate nucleus in Friedreich's ataxia. Furthermore, the increased magnetic susceptibility correlated with disease duration and severity of clinical features in some disorders. Although the number of studies is still limited in most of the neurodegenerative diseases, the existing evidence suggests that QSM can be a promising tool in the investigation of neurodegeneration.},

	abstract = {Spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 (SCA17) is a rare autosomal dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorder presenting with a variable phenotype including ataxia, dystonia, chorea, and parkinsonism, as well as cognitive impairment. We evaluated morphologic and functional imaging characteristics to elucidate evidence of neurodegeneration in SCA17, even in the presymptomatic stage of the disease.
METHODS: Nine individuals of 3 large SCA17 pedigrees, including 4 presymptomatic mutation carriers, underwent cranial 3-dimensional MRI volumetry, as well as multitracer PET with (18)F-FDG, (11)C-d-threo-methylphenidate, and (11)C-raclopride. Healthy subjects showing no signs of a neurologic or psychiatric disease served as controls.
RESULTS: MRI volumetry revealed atrophy of the cerebellum and caudate nucleus in manifesting patients (P = 0.04 and 0.05, respectively) and in presymptomatic mutation carriers (P = 0.04 and 0.01, respectively). PET demonstrated decreased glucose metabolism in the striatum, as well as in the cuneus, cingulum, and parietal lobe, in all SCA17 patients and presymptomatic mutation carriers. In addition, PET was closely correlated with motor performance as assessed by the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (P = 0.037) and Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (P = 0.05) and with cognitive function as assessed by the Mini-Mental Status Examination (P = 0.037). Furthermore, (11)C-raclopride PET showed impairment of the postsynaptic dopaminergic compartment of the putamen and caudate nucleus not only in manifest SCA17 patients (P = 0.04 and 0.008, respectively) but also in yet-unaffected mutation carriers (P = 0.05 and 0.05, respectively). The degree of postsynaptic dopaminergic dysfunction was associated with impairment of motor performance. In contrast, significant presynaptic dopaminergic deficits assessed with (11)C-d-threo-methylphenidate PET were not detected.
CONCLUSION: MRI volumetry, as well as (11)C-raclopride and (18)F-FDG PET, reveal neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration even in the presymptomatic stage and may serve as markers for disease activity in upcoming interventional trials on SCA17.},

	abstract = {The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a genetically heterogeneous group of autosomal dominantly inherited progressive disorders, the clinical hallmark of which is loss of balance and coordination accompanied by slurred speech; onset is most often in adult life. Genetically, SCAs are grouped as repeat expansion SCAs, such as SCA3/Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), and rare SCAs that are caused by non-repeat mutations, such as SCA5. Most SCA mutations cause prominent damage to cerebellar Purkinje neurons with consecutive cerebellar atrophy, although Purkinje neurons are only mildly affected in some SCAs. Furthermore, other parts of the nervous system, such as the spinal cord, basal ganglia and pontine nuclei in the brainstem, can be involved. As there is currently no treatment to slow or halt SCAs (many SCAs lead to premature death), the clinical care of patients with SCA focuses on managing the symptoms through physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy. Intense research has greatly expanded our understanding of the pathobiology of many SCAs, revealing that they occur via interrelated mechanisms (including proteotoxicity, RNA toxicity and ion channel dysfunction), and has led to the identification of new targets for treatment development. However, the development of effective therapies is hampered by the heterogeneity of the SCAs; specific therapeutic approaches may be required for each disease.},

	abstract = {The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) comprise more than 40 autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorders that present principally with progressive ataxia. Within the past few years, studies of pathogenic mechanisms in the SCAs have led to the development of promising therapeutic strategies, especially for SCAs caused by polyglutamine-coding CAG repeats. Nucleotide-based gene-silencing approaches that target the first steps in the pathogenic cascade are one promising approach not only for polyglutamine SCAs but also for the many other SCAs caused by toxic mutant proteins or RNA. For these and other emerging therapeutic strategies, well-coordinated preparation is needed for fruitful clinical trials. To accomplish this goal, investigators from the United States and Europe are now collaborating to share data from their respective SCA cohorts. Increased knowledge of the natural history of SCAs, including of the premanifest and early symptomatic stages of disease, will improve the prospects for success in clinical trials of disease-modifying drugs. In addition, investigators are seeking validated clinical outcome measures that demonstrate responsiveness to changes in SCA populations. Findings suggest that MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy biomarkers will provide objective biological readouts of disease activity and progression, but more work is needed to establish disease-specific biomarkers that track target engagement in therapeutic trials. Together, these efforts suggest that the development of successful therapies for one or more SCAs is not far away.},

Studies so far are lacking an appropriate registration to the infratentorial space. To circumvent these limitations, we applied a high-resolution atlas template of the human cerebellum and brainstem (SUIT template) to characterize regional cerebellar atrophy in Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) on 3-T MRI data. We used a spatially unbiased voxel-based morphometry approach together with T2-based manual segmentation, T2 histogram analysis, and atlas generation of the dentate nuclei in a representative cohort of 18 FRDA patients and matched healthy controls. We demonstrate that the cerebellar volume in FRDA is generally not significantly different from healthy controls but mild lobular atrophy develops beyond normal aging. The medial parts of lobule VI, housing the somatotopic representation of tongue and lips, are the major site of this lobular atrophy, which possibly reflects speech impairment. Extended white matter affection correlates with disease severity across and beyond the cerebellar inflow and outflow tracts. The dentate nucleus, as a major site of cerebellar degeneration, shows a mean volume loss of about 30\%. Remarkably, not the atrophy but the T2 signal decrease of the dentate nuclei highly correlates with disease duration and severity.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is the most common autosomal-recessive ataxia worldwide. It is characterized by early onset, sensory abnormalities and slowly progressive ataxia. All magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based studies have focused on the evaluation of adult patients. Therefore, we designed a cross-sectional multimodal MRI-based study to investigate the anatomical substrates involved in the early stages of FRDA.
METHODS: We enrolled 37 patients (12 children) and 38 controls. All subjects underwent MRI in a 3T device to assess gray and white matter. We used measures from FreeSurfer and CERES to evaluate the cerebral and cerebellar cortices. The T1 multiatlas assessed deep gray matter. The diffusion tensor imaging multiatlas was used to investigate microstructural abnormalities in brain white matter and SpineSeg was used to assess the cervical spinal cord. All analyses were corrected for multiple comparisons.
RESULTS: Comparison with age-matched controls showed that pediatric patients have spinal cord, inferior cerebellar peduncle and red nucleus damage. In contrast, adult patients showed more widespread white matter damage than pediatric patients. With regard to gray matter, we found cortical thinning at the left central sulcus and volumetric reduction in the thalami and hippocampi only in adult patients. Finally, values of fractional anisotropy in adult patients and radial diffusivity in pediatric patients from the inferior cerebellar peduncle correlated with disease duration and ataxia severity, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Structural damage in FRDA begins in the spinal cord and inferior cerebellar peduncle as well as the red nucleus, and progresses to cerebral areas in adulthood. These results shed some light on the early stages of FRDA and highlight potential neuroimaging markers for therapeutic trials.},

White matter structure can be measured using in vivo neuroimaging indices sensitive to different white matter features. For the first time, we examined the relative sensitivity and relationship between multiple white matter indices in Friedreich ataxia to more richly characterize disease expression and infer possible mechanisms underlying the observed white matter abnormalities. Diffusion-tensor, magnetization transfer, and T1-weighted structural images were acquired from 31 individuals with Friedreich ataxia and 36 controls. Six white matter indices were extracted: fractional anisotropy, diffusivity (mean, axial, radial), magnetization transfer ratio (microstructure), and volume (macrostructure). For each index, whole-brain voxel-wise between-group comparisons and correlations with disease severity, onset age, and gene triplet-repeat length were undertaken. Correlations between pairs of indices were assessed in the Friedreich ataxia cohort. Spatial similarities in the voxel-level pattern of between-group differences across the indices were also assessed. Microstructural abnormalities were maximal in cerebellar and brainstem regions, but evident throughout the brain, while macroscopic abnormalities were restricted to the brainstem. Poorer microstructure and reduced macrostructural volume correlated with greater disease severity and earlier onset, particularly in peri-dentate nuclei and brainstem regions. Microstructural and macrostructural abnormalities were largely independent. Reduced fractional anisotropy was most strongly associated with axial diffusivity in cerebral tracts, and magnetization transfer in cerebellar tracts. Multiple mechanisms likely underpin white matter abnormalities in Friedreich ataxia, with differential impacts in cerebellar and cerebral pathways.},
